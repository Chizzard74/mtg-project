# mtg-project
 
 Magic The Gathering card statistics and currency asessment. This project allows me to find the values of the cards I own and regularly check their values to varying degrees. It contains a Library (Hashtable) structure to hold cards I own, or cards I choose to add by name. 

 Currently in the process of shifting to Django framework.

 Still under construction
